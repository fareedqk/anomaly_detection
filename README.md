## Project Overview

Anomaly detection is critical in many domains such as fraud detection, network security, and predictive maintenance. This project provides a PyTorch framework to train models that can effectively detect anomalies in your data.

The repository includes:

- Custom dataset loaders  
- Model architectures for anomaly detection  
- Training and evaluation scripts  
- Utilities for data preprocessing and visualization  

## Dataset
